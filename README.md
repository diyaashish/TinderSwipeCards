# TinderSwipeCards

The project aims to implement a Tinder-like swipe card functionality using JavaScript and the Hammer.js library. The code enables users to swipe through a set of cards and perform actions such as "nope" or "love" on each card. The cards are initialized with initial positions, and touch gestures are detected using Hammer.js. As the user pans a card, the code adjusts its position, rotation, and visual styles. When the pan ends, the code determines whether to keep or remove the card based on the swipe distance and velocity. The "nope" and "love" buttons trigger corresponding actions, animating the card to the left or right. 

The project combines JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create an interactive and engaging swipe card experience.
